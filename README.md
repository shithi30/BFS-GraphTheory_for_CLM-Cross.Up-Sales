## A CLM Strategy for MX
by Shithi Maitra, Jr. Data Scientist 

### Objectives of the Study
- Designing an optimal journey of a customer from one defined service another desired service
- Retaining a customer to the platform and promote X-selling
- Gaining more control over a customer's life-cycle of taking services 
- Gaining confidence that a data-backed, statistical, algorithmic approach is being followed

### Proposed Methodology

<br><strong>Fig:</strong> Proposed process shown in flowchart<br><br>

- Preprocessing the users' data to view customers' cross-selling tendencies from one ServCat to top-03 (or top-05) ServCats: http://mb.sheba.xyz/question/16912
- Construct a bidirectional network graph as portraying the ServCats as nodes and the flexibility to move between ServCats as edges
- Define the source ServCat (A) and a destination ServCat (B) 
- Run a BFS(Breadth First Search) to find the optimal number of steps and path

### Action Points/Future Work 
- Predicting with ML which customers are likely to return: http://mb.sheba.xyz/question/16969
- Determining the service they last took and defining a high-bucket service we want to take them to 
- Making attempts of pitching them gradually along the optimized path
